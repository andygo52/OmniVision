  This is a comment.
   I can do a multiline comment between angle brackets of the comment tag.

   Here's what I want to do for this Project:

   1.  Overview - I want to showcase the Scratch programs I created by 
                  placing them on a web page and then sharing it to my 
                  cell phone.

   2.  This web page will have:
       aa. A comment
       a.  The basic html tags
       b.  A link tag inside the head tags
       c.  A title tag inside the head tags.
       d.  An H1 heading - the title of the web page
       e.  An introductory paragraph.
       f.  H2 tags for each of the game programs I created in Scratch.
       g.  A paragraph introducing each of the game programs I made.  
           What I like about it.  If it doesn't completely work, what 
           I found challenging about it.  
       h.  An image of each of the title screens for each of the game programs.
       i.  An image link that takes the viewer to the project page of the web page.
       j.  A style sheet with:
           i. a background image from Google images that covers the entire screen
           ii. fonts from Google fonts - at least 3.
           iii. borders around the images.
           iv.  text styles
           v.  CSS classes

      <h1>I am a Game Programmer!!!!</h1>
      <h3>By Mr. Goldstein</h3>
      
      <p class="intro">This year, we learned how to program by creating a lot of game programs in Scratch. We made a <em>Cat Double Jump</em>, a <em>Daleks</em> game, a <em>Rainbow Lines</em> program, an <em>Asteroids</em> game and a <em>Fruit Slicer</em> game.  --Thank you Al Sweigart for teaching us how to program!--</p>

        <ul class="daleks">
          <li>A teleport mechanism that transports the Cat to a random location on the Stage.  There's a cool down period of five seconds before the Cat can be teleported again.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A shield that protects the Cat for one second.  It that has a cool down period of ten seconds before the shield can be used again.  </li>
          <br>
          <li>A game over screen that doubles as a start screen.</li>

      <ul class="rainbow">
        <li>Created beautiful patterns of Rainbow Lines</li>

      <p class="asteroids">We created an Asteroids game program.  We learned how to code:</p>

        <li>Broadcast and Receive messages that coordinate game activity between sprites</li>

      <p class = "fruit">This was the final game program we created.  We programmed: </p>
      <ul class="fruit">
        <li class="fruit">The tracking of cursor locations using lists.</li>
        <li class="fruit">A Fruit Slicer that the player can use to slice fruit as they are tossed up in the air. </li>
        <li>A display of Health that decreases as fruit is missed and falls to the ground.</li>
		<li>A keypress that allows the player to recover their Health before they lose all of it and the game ends.</li>
		<li>A cloud variable that keeps track of the high score among all players.</li>
