       <p>We as a nation are now embarked upon a new millennium, which promises to transform and uplift our society if only we can prove up to the challenge.  One of the crucial challenges we are faced with is how to engage students to become empowered learners and strategic and effective thinkers.</p>
<p>Technology can be a key player in this transformation by offering processes and platforms that empower students to embrace a larger sense of self and experience themselves as creative players and agents of change in a global community.</p>

<p>Creativity is closely linked with Constructivism–the idea that we discover and create our own meaning from our experiences.  Technology provides a platform for students to publish their creative work.   Publishing is a strategy that nurtures the students’ conviction in the importance and urgency of their own ideas. Through providing opportunities for students to publish their work in extra-ordinary formats such as e-books, podcasts, videos, electronic portfolios, animation and websites, students learn that their work is important.  Their work emerges from the hidden confines of the four walls of the classroom into the larger world outside, and can impact others who encounter it.  Sharing their work with others through these various publishing venues can help inspire others on their own creative voyages.</p>

<p>In my Technology Education classroom at Omni Middle School,  students have arrived to class eager to embark on their creative explorations each day.  In contrast to classes such as mathematics that focus on convergent thinking in which the goal is to arrive at the right answer, the process students engage in as they create their own multimedia productions focuses on divergent thinking in which many solutions are possible.  Students  have taken ownership of their own learning process and assumed responsibility for developing their own ideas and making them work.  They get instant feedback from one another as they bounce ideas off of each other.  Their ideas for their multimedia projects are experiments that they try, and either see to completion or re-work as much as needed until their ideas bear fruit.  They see their powers of expression amplified through technology as they interact with technology to create.</p>

<p>As a Technology Education teacher, a Journalism teacher, and now a Computer Science teacher at Omni Middle School, I have developed curriculum aligned with State standards that have taught students problem solving and design skills as they have created multimedia projects to communicate their thoughts and ideas.  I  have collaborated with teachers on a school-wide level to showcase the talents and creative work of our students.   As a Smart Ambassador for Project Smart, I have instructed teachers on how to use a variety of emerging technologies and how to plan and implement instructional technology projects in the classroom.</p>

<p>I am eager to give of my talents and energies to bring our schools into the dawning of Web 2.0, in which students and teachers embrace a digital democracy of ideas, one in which students and teachers are not merely spectators but vital participants.</p>

       <p>My name is Andy Goldstein.  Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I studied journalism at Northwestern University.  During an internship at the Louisville Times, I became friends with Mike Covington, an artist who created illustrations for the Louisville Times, and that was the start of my lifelong love of art.  I studied art at Northwestern University under Ed Paschke, one of the leaders of the the Chicago Imagist movement.  I also studied at the University of Louisville, the Boca Museum School, with the sculptor Luis Montoya from West Palm Beach, the New York Academy of Art, and earned a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the Graduate School of Figurative Art of the New York Academy of Art.  After art school I painted at the Artist's Co-op in Delray, FL and exhibited at the Art of Africa in Delray, FL. </p>
       
 <p>Grateful for what I've learned, and wanting to give back, I became interested in teaching and earned my teaching degree from Florida Atlantic University.  I've been teaching ever since.  I currently teach a course in <i>Fundamentals of Web and Software Development</i> and <i>ICT Essentials.</i> You can view our class blog, which showcases my students' creative work at 
<a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"><i>Imagine</i></a>, and our class website, 
<a href="http://omnivision.website" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline"><i>OmniVision</i></a>.  I've also taught Yearbook, having earned the Walsworth publisher's award (awarded to its top 5 percent of yearbooks in the country) three years in a row.  You can view our <a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/yearbook/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">yearbook covers</a>, designed by students, handrawn, or designed in Flash or Photoshop.  We used Adobe InDesign to layout the pages of the yearbook.  I've also taught robotics, structures, PowerPoint, animation with Flash, stop-motion animation on iMac computers, creating ClayMation. I've taught game programming in Scratch and in Flash, and video production using iMovie and GarageBand on iMac computers. I teach web development using <i>Khan Academy</i>, <i>Code.org</i>, <i>Notepad++</i> and working with Dreamweaver to post our students' web pages to our class website.  In 2012, I was named one of four "Innovator Educators of the Year" in a county-wide competition sponsored by the School District of Palm Beach County and Microsoft.  I earned a trip to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington and showcased our students' work for our project, <i>Invent</i>.  I was one of 72 Regional winners that year for <a href="http://weblogs.pbspaces.com/mrgoldstein/2012/08/07/microsoft-partners-in-learning-u-s-forum-2012/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Microsoft Partners in Learning U.S. Forum 2012</i></a> (Scroll down to Andy Goldstein in Florida). </p>

					<p ><strong>INVENT!</strong> is a project-based learning curriculum in which students learn to collaborate
				in groups as they utilize the design process to build knowledge and skills with various technologies and computer
						applications.</p>
				<p><strong>Students form groups and brainstorm an idea for an invention.</strong> This could be
				something of practical use or it could be something utterly fantastic.  They work with their idea and develop
					it across a variety of technological media, beginning with a simple sketch on paper.  </p>
				<p><strong>They then "grow" their idea</strong> in a poster, a script, a storyboard and then a video commercial which tells people about their invention and shows it in action.  <strong>They write about their experience</strong> using the design process, then make their essays talk by creating a Voki at voki.com. </p>
