&image6text=Author:  John Steinbeck
Main Characters:  Lenny and George
Short Summary:  Of Mice and Men is about two men, Lenny and George.  Lenny is a tall, strong man, like a bull, but he's slow in the head, he's retarded.  His companion George is short, skinny, dark of face and fairly smart.  Both of them live a dramatic life looking for jobs because Lenny always gets them in trouble.  Their dream of getting their own piece of land to build a farm is far away.  George is working on it though, but it's hard for Lenny to learn. 
My opinion:  I personally think this book is very good.  It's great because it shows the relationship George has with Lenny, and the sacrifices he does for a mentally challenged person like Lenny.  The book is very interesting, and a few parts are funny.  If you like drama, then read it!!

&image10title=Hoot

&image10text=Author:  Carl Hiaasen
Main Characters: Roy Eberhardt, Dana Mantherson, Mullet Fingers, Beatrice Leap, and Garrett.
Summary:  Roy Eberhardt has recently and unhappily moved to Florida.  "Disney World is an armpit," he states flatly compared to Montana.  Roy's family moves a lot, so he's used to being the new kid.  Florida bullies are pretty much like bullies everywhere.  But Roy finds himself oddly indebted to the bully Dana Mantherson.  If Dana hadn't been sinking his thumbs into Roy's temples and smashing his face against the school bus window, Roy might have never seen the interesting boy running by.  The boy was about Roy's age.  He didn't have any books or a backpack and here's the odd part--no shoes.  Sensing a mystery, Roy sets himself on the boy's trail.  On the search, he encounters many strange events.  For him, life in Florida is looking up.
My opinion: I think this is a good book.  I think the book was good because I like to read mysteries and this book is a great mystery.  I also like how the author Carl Hiaasen writes.  I would recommend this book to people who like mysteries.  So if you like mystery books, this book would be a definite winner!

Sort Summary:  A loving threesome, they ranged the dark hills and river bottoms of the Cherokee County.  Old Dan had the brawn, Little Ann had the brains--and Billy had the will to train them to be the finest hunting team in the valley.

Short Summary:  Alex Rider is a secret agent.  On this mission he must go to a school called Point Blank.  He is going to find out what is going on in the school.  The school is meant for bad kids.

My Opinion:  My opinion of Point Blank is that I like it a lot because it had a lot of action and had a lot of suspense and always wanted to read just a page more, but it wasn't one of the best books I have read.  That's my opinion on the book Point Blank.
